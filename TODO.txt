Build a kind of bold tool - inputs <b> into the text so that analysts can copy and paste this into the chrome extension. 

Build the JSON so it’s easily editable by Alicia - this way we can keep it up to date on copies

Pull the Fresh VS BE VS etc. from the avail JSON’s so that Alicia can update with whatever copies she thinks makes sense

Tool that queries a “test’ email to get sent to you in this format (my idea)
